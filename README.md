 ## Project Scope
 To clearly outline the boundaries and goals of the emulator, ensuring focus and clarity throughout development
 
 ## Objectives:
o	Create a basic CPU emulator that supports essential CPU functions (arithmetic, logical, data movement, control flow).
o	Gain hands-on experience with CPU architecture concepts, including instruction execution and memory management.
o	Design a modular structure that can be expanded with additional instructions or features in the future.

## Technologies Used üíª
