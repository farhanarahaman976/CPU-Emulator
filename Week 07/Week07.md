Week 7: Advanced Features
Objective:
Enhance the Virtual CPU Emulator by implementing advanced CPU functionalities that include branching, control flow, subroutines, interrupts, and a basic pipeline mechanism.

Tasks and Breakdown:
1. Implement Branching and Control Flow Instructions
Branching Instructions:
Add support for conditional (e.g., BEQ, BNE, BGT) and unconditional branches (e.g., JMP).
Update the instruction set to include opcodes for these operations.
Modify the Instruction Decode phase to evaluate branch conditions using flags (e.g., zero, carry, negative, or overflow).
Control Flow:
Ensure proper program counter (PC) updates when a branch or jump is taken.
Handle pipeline flushes if branching is mispredicted in the pipeline.

Here’s how you can approach Week 7: Advanced Features in your project:

Objective:
Enhance the Virtual CPU Emulator by implementing advanced CPU functionalities that include branching, control flow, subroutines, interrupts, and a basic pipeline mechanism.

Tasks and Breakdown:
1. Implement Branching and Control Flow Instructions
Branching Instructions:
Add support for conditional (e.g., BEQ, BNE, BGT) and unconditional branches (e.g., JMP).
Update the instruction set to include opcodes for these operations.
Modify the Instruction Decode phase to evaluate branch conditions using flags (e.g., zero, carry, negative, or overflow).
Control Flow:
Ensure proper program counter (PC) updates when a branch or jump is taken.
Handle pipeline flushes if branching is mispredicted in the pipeline.

2. Add Support for Subroutines and Interrupts
Subroutines:
Add instructions for calling (CALL) and returning (RET) from subroutines.
Use a stack to save the return address during a CALL.
Implement a stack pointer (SP) for managing function calls.
Interrupts:
Define interrupt vectors and a mechanism for saving the CPU state (e.g., registers and PC) on interrupt.
Add an INT instruction to trigger an interrupt.
Implement an interrupt service routine (ISR) mechanism.
Restore the saved state upon completing the ISR.
3. Integrate a Simple Pipeline Mechanism
Create a 3-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute) or a 5-stage pipeline (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Write-back).
Handle hazards:
Data Hazards: Implement forwarding or stall mechanisms.
Control Hazards: Implement branch prediction and pipeline flushing for incorrect predictions.
Update the CPU core logic to process instructions at different stages concurrently.

Testing Plan:
Write test cases for:
Branching instructions with different conditions.
Subroutine calls and returns, including recursive calls.
Interrupt handling with simultaneous tasks.
Evaluate the pipeline with simple programs that include dependencies, control flow changes, and branching.
Monitor performance improvements from the pipeline.

Deliverables:

Enhanced CPU with branching, subroutines, interrupts, and pipeline support.
Test cases for the new features.
