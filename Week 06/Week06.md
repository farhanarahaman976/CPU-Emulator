# Week 6: I/O Operations
## Objective: Enable basic input/output operations for the virtual CPU.

### Tasks:
**01.Simulate I/O Devices:**

- Implement a keyboard for input:
  - Simulate capturing user input through terminal or predefined scripts.
- Implement a display for output:
  - Create functionality to print text or numbers to the terminal or a GUI window.
    
**02.Define and Integrate I/O Instructions:**

- Design specific I/O instructions in the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), such as:
  - **READ:** For reading input from the keyboard.
  - **WRITE:** For writing output to the display.
- Update the instruction decoder to recognize and handle I/O instructions.
- Integrate I/O functionality into the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
  
**03.Test I/O Operations:**

- Develop I/O-intensive programs to test the system, such as:
  - A basic text input/output program.
  - A program that echoes user input.
  - A number-based calculator using keyboard input and display output.
- Ensure error handling for invalid I/O operations, such as unsupported devices.

**04.Debug and Refine:**

- Test edge cases like:
  - Handling empty input or invalid input formats.
  - Simultaneous I/O operations.
- Optimize the CPU-I/O communication for better performance.
