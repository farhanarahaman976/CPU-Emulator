# Week 9: Final Testing & Debugging
## Objective:
Ensure the Virtual CPU Emulator works correctly by testing, debugging, and validating its performance.

### Tasks & Implementation:
**Test with Assembly Programs:**

Executed various test cases, including arithmetic, branching, memory operations, and complex programs (factorial, Fibonacci, etc.).
**Debugging & Fixes:**

Identified and resolved issues like incorrect register values, infinite loops, stack overflow, and memory corruption using logging, step-by-step execution, and breakpoints.
**Performance Validation:**

Measured execution speed, memory access latency, and instruction efficiency to optimize performance.
**Results:**
✔ All test cases passed without errors.
✔ Improved stability and efficiency.
✔ Successfully validated performance benchmarks.

**Next Steps:**
Final code review and optimization.
Prepare project documentation for submission.
